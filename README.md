## Installation

* Install the extension through the standard extension installation section.
* Go to the modules section and install the "Custom templates Pro" module.

## Management

#### Nuances

* Paths to templates are specified without a file extension. For example common/home or extension/module/featured.
* The template to be replaced is assigned in the first pop-up window. The template that will replace it is in the second one (in the conditional form).
* Be careful not to forget about third-party modifications that make changes to template files. The module has a function to display a list of modifications that make changes to the template file being replaced. This makes it much easier to find the right modifiers. I recommend using any convenient modification editor for quick editing of modifiers.

#### Example

Let's say we need to replace the template of a certain product (product.twig) with our own (product_showcase.twig). For this:

* make a copy of catalog/view/theme/our-theme/product/product.twig and name it product_showcase.twig;
* open product_showcase.twig and make the changes we need;
* go to the "Custom templates Pro" extension page and create a new replacement. In the first pop-up window, enter product / product, in the second; product/product_showcase and select the conditions we need or products for which we need to change the template;
* save the settings.

If you have any questions, write to the support thread or private messages.
